## 8. Source Verification Log

| Date and time | Snapshot | Verification method | Result classification | Change detected | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | Commit comparison / named-version check / visual comparison / checksum / other | Unchanged / Expected output / Unexpected change / Unavailable | Yes / No / Unknown | ... |

Record checks before stages, after meaningful pauses, before tasks, and before final acceptance. Current snapshot status remains in the workflow record in CLI-managed mode.

## 9. Upstream Rebaseline and Impact Assessments

| New snapshot | Previous snapshot | Change summary | Affected artifacts | Earliest affected stage | Required action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Open / In progress / Complete |

Use this table for changed upstream inputs or unexpected concurrent changes, not for approved task output commits.

## 10. Baseline Review

### Pass 1 — Completeness and correctness

- [ ] Every material source has a snapshot ID and evidence section.
- [ ] Exact scope and capture time are recorded.
- [ ] Repository snapshots use commit SHAs in the canonical registry.
- [ ] Task outputs have parent snapshots and task IDs in the canonical registry.
- [ ] Mutable sources are not mislabeled as immutable.
- [ ] Access and reproduction limitations are explicit.

### Pass 2 — Consistency, traceability, source integrity, risks, and uncertainty

- [ ] Generated source state is current in CLI-managed mode.
- [ ] Identifiers follow `Identifier-Conventions.md`.
- [ ] Expected implementation outputs are distinguished from upstream source changes.
- [ ] Rebaseline impact assessments cover unexpected upstream changes.
- [ ] Evidence sections do not redefine record-owned status or lineage.
- [ ] No artifact silently relies on undefined or newer source content.
