# Workflow State Ownership

This document prevents executable state from being maintained independently in several files.

The workflow has two control modes:

- **CLI-managed:** `.workflow/workflow-record.json` is canonical. Generated Markdown under `.workflow/generated/` is read-only projection state.
- **Markdown-only:** no workflow record exists. Rendered fallback registries in the narrative artifacts are maintained manually. This mode is scaffolded but not executable.

Never mix ownership modes for the same field.

## Canonical ownership in CLI-managed mode

| Information | Canonical owner | Human-readable projection |
|---|---|---|
| Profile and execution mode | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/WORKFLOW-STATUS.md` |
| Stage, workflow status, current task, latest output, and latest validation runtime | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/WORKFLOW-STATUS.md` |
| Current architecture decision | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/WORKFLOW-STATUS.md` |
| Snapshot registry and output lineage | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/SOURCE-INDEX.md` |
| Append-only source verification history | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/SOURCE-INDEX.md` |
| Artifact ID, type, narrative path, lifecycle state, baseline, and replacement | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/ARTIFACT-INDEX.md` |
| Stage-decision history and approval actors | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/WORKFLOW-STATUS.md` |
| Task state, blockers, dependencies, structured checks, and outputs | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/TASK-INDEX.md` |
| Canonical domain definitions, owners, required classification, and upstream graph | `workflow-record.json` | `generated/TRACEABILITY.md` |
| Downstream plan, task, and validation coverage | Derived from the record | `generated/TRACEABILITY.md` |
| Profile-upgrade and final-result history | `workflow-record.json` | Status and artifact projections |
| Detailed source scope, reproduction, authority, and limitations | `SOURCE-BASELINE.md`, `WORKPACK.md`, or the relevant narrative artifact | Not generated |
| Product, design, behavioral, architecture, and implementation rationale | Matching narrative artifact | Not generated |
| Human-readable blockers, assumptions, exceptions, and decision rationale beyond structured fields | `WORKFLOW-STATE.md` or `WORKPACK.md` | Not generated |
| Task objective, implementation steps, discoveries, risks, and completion narrative | Task file or `WORKPACK.md` | Not generated |

Generated files are never decision owners.

## Generated views

The CLI renders:

```text
.workflow/generated/WORKFLOW-STATUS.md
.workflow/generated/SOURCE-INDEX.md
.workflow/generated/ARTIFACT-INDEX.md
.workflow/generated/TASK-INDEX.md
.workflow/generated/TRACEABILITY.md
```

Each view includes a generated-file warning, source record name, and canonical SHA-256 digest. Object-key ordering does not affect the digest; meaningful array ordering does.

## Mutation contract

Every executable record mutation uses the same transaction boundary:

1. read and validate the current record;
2. clone it and apply the proposal in memory;
3. render the candidate record, all generated views, and new narrative files in memory;
4. validate the complete candidate;
5. write sibling temporary files and atomically rename the file set;
6. restore original bytes and remove temporary files after any write failure.

Validation failure happens before target replacement. A rejected operation must leave the record, generated views, and narrative files byte-identical.

The current record must be clean before advancement, task execution, or acceptance. A command specifically intended to repair state may commit only when the resulting finding set is strictly smaller and contains no new finding.

## Narrative-file rules

Templates contain explicit artifact and control-mode markers. Rendering extracts only the artifact body, converts fenced example YAML into real frontmatter, substitutes project values, and removes record-owned sections in CLI-managed mode.

When CLI-managed mode is active:

- `WORKFLOW-STATE.md` contains narrative blockers, assumptions, exceptions, and decision history without copying current stage, profile, task, output, or registries.
- `SOURCE-BASELINE.md` contains source scope, evidence, reproduction, authority, limitations, and rebaseline impact without copying the mutable snapshot registry.
- `TASKS-INDEX.md` contains phase rationale, coverage, coordination, and cross-cutting concerns without copying mutable task status or output tables.
- task artifacts contain objectives, scope, implementation detail, acceptance criteria, risks, and discoveries without copying record-owned validation result or output-lineage state.
- any narrative may cite canonical IDs but must not redefine their current record-owned fields.

The CLI never overwrites an existing unregistered narrative. If a stage destination exists, use `artifact adopt` before advancement.

Markdown-only rendering includes the complete fallback registries. No record, generated views, parser, or lifecycle enforcement is introduced.

## Lifecycle history

- Verification, gate, and implementation-review events are append-only.
- A new active stage decision supersedes the previous active decision without deleting it.
- Rewind supersedes active gates at and after the target while preserving artifact baselines.
- Snapshot supersession records replacement but never rewrites narrative baselines.
- Artifact supersession records a replacement; reopening preserves history and returns the artifact to Draft.
- Profile upgrades are two-phase and downgrade is unsupported.
- Task blocking stores the previous status so unblocking restores it.
- Final completion is set only by an accepted final-review event.

## Schema-v1 boundary

Schema-v1 records remain readable but are mutation-locked. Explicit migration assigns the v2 collections and records the existing stage as `legacyBoundary`. Historical gates are not fabricated. Inferred trace definitions remain visible and optional until classified.

```bash
design-workflow migrate --check
design-workflow migrate
```

## Synchronization commands

Normal mutations synchronize views automatically. If a record was intentionally edited outside the CLI, treat it as untrusted until both commands pass:

```bash
design-workflow sync
design-workflow validate
```

Check without writing:

```bash
design-workflow sync --check
```

Commit the record and generated views together. A stale or missing view is a validation failure, never an alternative source of truth.

## Review checklist

- [ ] The workflow uses exactly one control mode.
- [ ] Every executable field has one canonical owner.
- [ ] The record is schema v2 before mutation.
- [ ] Generated views match the current record digest.
- [ ] No generated file contains manual decisions or rationale.
- [ ] CLI-managed artifacts omit record-owned status, registries, validation results, and output lineage.
- [ ] Markdown-only artifacts retain complete fallback registries.
- [ ] Snapshot, artifact, gate, task, profile, and final-review history is preserved rather than rewritten.
- [ ] Trace definitions have active compatible owners and required coverage.
- [ ] CI detects schema drift, stale generated views, broken packaged links, and invalid records.
