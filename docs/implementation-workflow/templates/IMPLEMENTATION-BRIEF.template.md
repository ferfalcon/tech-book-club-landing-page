# Implementation Brief Template

Use this template only with the Lite profile. It consolidates requirements, design intent, specification, and planning while preserving ownership boundaries and identifier namespaces.

Reference only snapshot IDs defined in `SOURCE-BASELINE.md`.

# Implementation Brief

## 1. Document Information

- Status: Draft
- Scope:
- Last updated:
- Project context: `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`
- Source baseline: `SOURCE-BASELINE.md`
- Evidence baseline: `DESIGN-AUDIT.md`
- Repository snapshot: `SRC-REPO-*`

## 2. Requirements

### Goals and non-goals

- ...

### REQ-FR-001 — Requirement title

- Classification:
- Priority:
- Description:
- Snapshot or evidence:
- Acceptance criteria:

Record applicable `REQ-AR-*`, `REQ-NFR-*`, `REQ-CON-*`, and other requirement types separately.

## 3. Design Intent

### DES-001 — Design decision title

- Classification:
- Intent:
- Snapshot and evidence:
- Requirement references:

### Responsive and interaction intent

Use `DES-RWD-*` and `DES-INT-*` identifiers. Document supplied viewport evidence, behavior between examples, states, content edge cases, and accessibility intent from the pinned design snapshots.

## 4. Specification

### SPEC-BEH-001 — Behavior title

- Requirement and design references:
- Source snapshots:
- Observable behavior:
- States and edge cases:
- Acceptance criteria: `AC-*`

Record applicable `SPEC-INT-*`, `SPEC-ACC-*`, `SPEC-VAL-*`, and `SPEC-DATA-*` items separately.

Do not invent arbitrary breakpoints, focus behavior, thresholds, or unsupported business rules.

## 5. Repository Context

- Repository snapshot: `SRC-REPO-*`
- Existing files and conventions:
- Reusable components, tokens, utilities, and tests:
- Confirmed commands:
- Constraints and technical debt:

Distinguish observed paths from proposed paths and do not rely on branch changes outside the pinned commit.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### PLAN-001 — Plan item title

- Objective:
- Requirement and specification references:
- Source snapshots:
- Files and modules:
- Dependencies:
- Implementation steps:
- Integrated accessibility, responsive, state, error, and test work:
- Validation:

Do not create a separate late accessibility implementation phase.

## 7. Architecture Decision

- Separate architecture needed: Yes / No
- Reason:

If the work requires meaningful routing, shared state, persistence, authentication, integrations, deployment, security, privacy, or migration decisions, upgrade to Standard or Full rather than overloading this brief.

## 8. Source-change Handling

- Snapshot verification required before task execution:
- Material changes that invalidate this brief:
- Earliest workflow section or stage to revisit:

Create new `SRC-*` IDs and perform an impact assessment rather than silently updating this brief to newer sources.

## 9. Risks, Assumptions, and Questions

### Blocking

- ...

### Non-blocking

- ...

## 10. Traceability

| Snapshot or evidence | Requirement | Design | Specification or criterion | Plan item | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 11. Review Pass 1 — Completeness and Correctness

- [ ] Scope and pinned repository context are accurate.
- [ ] Snapshot IDs exist and were actually used.
- [ ] Requirements, design intent, testable behavior, and implementation planning are complete for the Lite scope.
- [ ] Responsive, accessibility, states, errors, content edge cases, and validation are integrated.
- [ ] The work still qualifies for Lite.

## 12. Corrections from Pass 1

- ...

## 13. Review Pass 2 — Consistency, Traceability, Source Integrity, Risks, and Uncertainty

- [ ] Ownership sections and identifiers remain distinct.
- [ ] Every material plan item maps to approved requirements or specifications and pinned sources.
- [ ] No source changed silently after the brief baseline was recorded.
- [ ] No unsupported scope or assumption is presented as confirmed.
- [ ] Blocking questions are visible.
- [ ] Corrections from the first pass were included before this review.

## 14. Readiness

Select exactly one:

- `Ready for task decomposition`
- `Ready with documented non-blocking assumptions`
- `Blocked by unresolved decisions`
